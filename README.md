Probabilistic Deep Learning: Python, Keras and TensorFlow Probability is an increasingly popular probabilistic approach to deep learning that allows us to refine our results more quickly and accurately without much trial-and-error testing. 
Trying to implement practical techniques that use the Python based Tensorflow prob framework, to build highly-performant deep learning applications that can reliably handle the noise and uncertainty of real-world data.
